Editor:
i)a page where we can write or create programs.
ii)Editors widely used on Linux systems are vi and emacs.
Preprocessor and Compiler:
i)preprocessor is  the command to compile the program.
ii) in C a preprocessor program executes automatically before the compilerâ€™s translation phase begins.
iii)The C preprocessor follows special commands called preprocessor directives,which shows that certain change are to be performed on the program before compilation.
iv)the compiler translates the C program into machine-language code. 
Linker:
A linker links the object code with the code for the missing functions to produce an executable image, and if the program links correctly then a file called a.out is
produced. This is the executable image of the program wriiten.
Loader:
Before a program can be executed, the program must first be placed in memory which takes the executable image from disk and transfers it to memory.
Disk:
The program is placed in this memory alocation by the loader.
CPU:
CPU takes each instruction in the program and executes it, possibly storing new data values as per the program instructions.
